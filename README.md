CS 148 - Summer 2017

The starter code for all assignments will live within this repository!
If you find a bug in any of the starter code we post here, we'll award you extra credit, so hunt away, let us know, and we'll push new changes here as necessary.

Getting started:

On this page, click on the button (above and to the right) which says: "Clone or Download". If you're new to git, try downloading the repository as a .zip file.

Good luck! Looking forward to a fun quarter.
